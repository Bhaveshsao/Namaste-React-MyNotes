# Chapter 3: Laying the Foundation

## Running a Project Using `npx parcel`

### Command to Run the Project
To execute the project using Parcel, the command is:

```bash
npx parcel index.html
```

#### What This Command Means:
- **`npx`**: Executes an npm package (in this case, Parcel) directly from `node_modules` or downloads it temporarily.
- **Source File**: Specifies the entry file for Parcel (e.g., `index.html`).

### What Happens When You Run This Command?
1. **Creates a Development Build**:
   - Parcel generates a development version of your project, optimized for testing and debugging.
2. **Hosts the Project Locally**:
   - Starts a development server and hosts your project at `http://localhost:1234`.
3. **Tracks Changes**:
   - Automatically updates the project using **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** whenever you make changes to your code.

### Limitation: Repeated Commands
Manually typing commands like `npx parcel index.html` (for development) or `npx parcel build index.html` (for production) repeatedly can be tedious. To simplify this, we use **npm scripts**.

---

## What Are `npm` Scripts?

### Definition
`npm` scripts are custom commands stored in the `scripts` section of `package.json`. They:

- Simplify repetitive tasks, such as starting a development server or building a production-ready project.
- Provide a standardized way of running commands across projects and teams.

### How to Add `npm` Scripts

1. Open your `package.json` file.
2. Locate the `scripts` section (or create one if it doesn’t exist).
3. Add custom scripts for development and production builds.

### Example `scripts` Section
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "build": "parcel build index.html"
  }
}
```

- **`start` Script**:
  - Executes: `npx parcel index.html`.
  - Starts the development server.
- **`build` Script**:
  - Executes: `npx parcel build index.html`.
  - Creates a production-ready build.

---

## Running `npm` Scripts

Once you’ve defined the scripts, you can use simpler commands to execute them:

### Running Development Server

1. **Using `npm run` Command**:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
2. **Shortcut for `start`**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - `start` is a **reserved keyword** in `npm`, allowing the `run` keyword to be skipped.

### Building for Production

1. **Using `npm run` Command**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. **No Shortcut for `build`**:
   - Unlike `start`, you must include `run` for the `build` script:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```

---

## Industry Standards for `npm` Scripts

### Importance of Scripts in Industry Projects
1. **Standardization**:
   - Scripts provide a standardized way to define and execute commands, making collaboration easier across teams.
2. **Ease of Use**:
   - New developers can easily onboard by referring to the `scripts` section in `package.json`.
3. **Simplifies Project Commands**:
   - Common commands like `start` and `build` are intuitive and reduce manual errors.

### How to Identify Project Commands
To find the relevant commands for any project:
1. Open the `package.json` file.
2. Look under the `scripts` section.
3. Use the defined scripts (e.g., `start` or `build`) to execute tasks.

---

### Command Equivalents
1. **Development**:
   - `npx parcel index.html` = `npm start`.
2. **Production**:
   - `npx parcel build index.html` = `npm run build`.


### Reserved Keywords
- **`start`**:
  - Has a shortcut (`npm start` = `npm run start`).
- **`build`**:
  - No shortcut available; always use `npm run build`.

### Development and Production Commands
1. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. **Build for Production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Output
- **Development**:
  - Hosted at `http://localhost:1234`.
- **Production**:
  - Optimized files are saved in the `dist` folder.

## Understanding React Elements

### What Are React Elements?
React elements are the building blocks of React applications. They are **plain JavaScript objects** that represent a part of the user interface (UI).

### Creating React Elements with `createElement`
Example:
```javascript
const heading = React.createElement("h1", { id: "heading" }, "Namaste React");
```
- **Function**: `React.createElement`.
- **Arguments**:
  1. **Tag Name**: Specifies the type of HTML tag (e.g., `"h1"`).
  2. **Attributes**: An object defining attributes like `id`, `class`, etc.
  3. **Children**: Content or child elements inside the tag.

### How React Elements Work
1. **JavaScript Object**:
   - React elements are plain JavaScript objects created by `React.createElement`.
   - Example object:
     ```javascript
     {
       type: "h1",
       props: {
         id: "heading",
         children: "Namaste React"
       }
     }
     ```
2. **Rendering**:
   - `ReactDOM.render` converts this object into a real DOM element.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
     root.render(heading);
     ```

### Behind the Scenes: Rendering React Elements
1. **React Element Creation**:
   - `React.createElement` creates a JavaScript object representing the element.
2. **Render to DOM**:
   - `ReactDOM.render` injects the React element into the DOM, replacing the content of the root element.
2. **Flow**:
   - React's createElement function transforms descriptions of UI elements into a JavaScript object. This object is later rendered into a real HTML element by ReactDOM, completing the flow from code to visible content. 
   ```bash
   React.createElement ==> React Element (JavaScript Object) ==> After Rendering (via ReactDOM) ==> HTML Element
   ```
---

## Introducing JSX

### Why Use JSX?

Using `React.createElement` for complex structures becomes verbose and hard to manage. JSX simplifies this process with a more readable syntax. JSX allows developers to write code that closely resembles HTML, making it more intuitive for creating user interfaces.

### What is JSX?

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It:

- Resembles HTML but is not HTML.
- Compiles to `React.createElement` calls under the hood.
- Makes complex UI structures easier to read and write.

Example:

```jsx
const heading = <h1 id="heading">Namaste React</h1>;
```

Compiles to:

```javascript
const heading = React.createElement("h1", { id: "heading" }, "Namaste React");
```

### Key Points About JSX

1. **Not HTML**:
   - JSX looks like HTML but compiles to JavaScript.
   - It is closer to XML-like syntax, but not XML either.
2. **Improves Readability**:
   - Intuitive and reduces verbosity, especially for nested structures.
3. **Community Standard**:
   - Widely used in the React ecosystem.

### Example: Nested Elements

Using `React.createElement`:

```javascript
const nested = React.createElement("div", {},
  React.createElement("h1", {}, "Heading"),
  React.createElement("p", {}, "This is a paragraph.")
);
```

Using JSX:

```jsx
const nested = (
  <div>
    <h1>Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </div>
);
```

### Rendering JSX

```jsx
const heading = <h1 id="heading">Namaste React</h1>;
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(heading);
```

**Output in Browser**:

```html
<h1 id="heading">Namaste React</h1>
```

### Debugging with JSX

- Use placeholder text (e.g., "Not Rendered") in the root element for debugging.
- Example:
  ```html
  <div id="root">Not Rendered</div>
  ```

## Q: From now onwards we will use only JSX, we will never use React.createElement, If we are going to use only JSX, why did we learn `React.createElement`?

### A:

While it’s true that we primarily use JSX in modern React development, understanding `React.createElement` is essential for grasping the **core concepts** of React. Here's why:

1. **Core Mechanism**:

   - JSX is just syntactic sugar for `React.createElement`.
   - Learning `React.createElement` helps you understand what JSX compiles to and how React elements are created.

2. **Behind-the-Scenes Knowledge**:

   - React uses `React.createElement` internally to convert JSX into JavaScript objects (React elements).
   - Knowing this provides a deeper understanding of how React works, making you a better developer.

3. **Debugging and Edge Cases**:

   - In rare cases, understanding `React.createElement` can help debug complex issues or work in environments where JSX is not supported.

4. **JSX is Optional**:

   - JSX is not mandatory in React. Knowing `React.createElement` allows you to write React code even without JSX if needed.

5. **Interview Preparation**:

   - Many technical interviews test your understanding of React’s internals. Knowing `React.createElement` demonstrates a solid foundation in React.

Although we will use JSX for its simplicity and readability, learning `React.createElement` ensures you have a comprehensive understanding of React’s inner workings.

---

## Q: Is JSX part of React, or a separate thing?

### A: **JSX is separate from React.** While JSX is commonly used with React, it is not a part of React itself. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **What is JSX?**

   - JSX (JavaScript XML) is a **syntax extension** for JavaScript.
   - It allows you to write HTML-like code in JavaScript, which is then transpiled into React function calls (e.g., `React.createElement`) by tools like Babel.

2. **How JSX Works with React:**

   - JSX is a **tool** that makes writing React components easier and more readable.
   - Behind the scenes, JSX is converted into JavaScript that React understands.
   - For example:
     ```jsx
     const heading = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
     ```
     Compiles to:
     ```javascript
     const heading = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, World!");
     ```

3. **Is JSX Necessary for React?**

   - **No**, JSX is not mandatory for React development.
   - You can use React without JSX by directly using `React.createElement`. However, JSX simplifies coding and is widely adopted in the React ecosystem.

4. **Why is JSX Often Associated with React?**

   - JSX was introduced by Facebook as a way to simplify creating React elements.
   - Although JSX can technically be used with other libraries, it is most commonly used with React.

5. **Separate Entities:**

   - JSX is not React.
   - React is a library for building user interfaces.
   - JSX is a syntax extension that makes it easier to write React code.

### JSX is **not part of React**. It is a separate tool that enhances the React development experience by simplifying the process of creating React elements.

---

## How JSX is Transpiled

### Q: Is JSX valid JavaScript?

### A:

No, **JSX is not valid JavaScript**. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Why JSX is not valid JavaScript?**

   - **JavaScript Engines Cannot Understand JSX**:

     - Browsers and JavaScript engines (like V8) are designed to execute JavaScript based on the ECMAScript specification (e.g., ES6, ES2020, etc.).
     - JSX introduces HTML-like syntax, which is not part of the ECMAScript standard. Thus, browsers will throw a syntax error if they encounter JSX code directly.

   - **What Happens Without Transpilation?**

     - If you write JSX like this:
       ```jsx
       const heading = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;
       ```
     - The browser’s JavaScript engine cannot parse this code because it doesn’t understand the `<>` syntax.
     - It would throw a syntax error such as:
       ```
       SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'
       ```

2. **How Does JSX Work?**

   - **JSX Needs to Be Transpiled**:

     - JSX code is **transpiled** (converted) into valid JavaScript code before it reaches the browser.
     - This transpilation is handled by **Babel**.

   - **Transpilation Example**:

     - JSX Code:
       ```jsx
       const heading = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;
       ```
     - Transpiled JavaScript Code:
       ```javascript
       const heading = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, JSX!");
       ```

   - **Who Does the Transpilation?**

     - **Parcel** acts as a manager and delegates the transpilation task to **Babel**.
     - Babel converts JSX into `React.createElement` calls, which are valid JavaScript code that browsers can understand.

3. **What is Babel?**

   - **Babel**:

     - A **JavaScript compiler** (or transpiler).
     - Converts modern JavaScript (e.g., ES6, JSX) into older versions of JavaScript that are compatible with most browsers.
     - Converts JSX syntax into React code that browsers and JavaScript engines can execute.

   - **Babel Workflow**:

     1. Reads the JSX code.
     2. Parses it into tokens.
     3. Converts it into React-compatible JavaScript.

   - **Example Using Babel Playground**:

     - Input:
       ```jsx
       const heading = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;
       ```
     - Output (after Babel transpilation):
       ```javascript
       const heading = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, JSX!");
       ```

---

### JSX Workflow

```markdown
JSX (via Babel) ==> React.createElement ==> React Element (JavaScript Object) ==> After Rendering (via ReactDOM) ==> HTML Element
```

This workflow demonstrates how JSX code is processed and ultimately rendered in the browser. Each step ensures compatibility, performance, and readability.

---
### Key Takeaways from JSX and Babel Workflow

1. **JSX is not valid JavaScript.** It must be transpiled into JavaScript that the browser can understand.
   - Browsers do not support JSX natively and require transpilers like Babel.
2. **Babel Transpilation Process:**
   - Converts JSX code into React-specific JavaScript (`React.createElement` calls).
   - Ensures compatibility across various browsers.
3. **React.createElement:**
   - Underpins JSX by creating React elements programmatically.
   - Results in JavaScript objects representing DOM nodes.
4. **ReactDOM Rendering Process:**
   - Converts React elements (JavaScript objects) into actual HTML elements rendered on the webpage.
5. **Development Workflow:**
   - Code written in JSX is transpiled -> converted to JavaScript objects (React elements) -> rendered into HTML via ReactDOM.

## HTML vs JSX

### Is JSX HTML?

No, JSX is not HTML. It’s a syntax extension for JavaScript that resembles HTML for better readability and developer convenience. However, there are key differences between JSX and HTML.

### Differences Between HTML and JSX

| **Feature**               | **HTML**                        | **JSX**                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Syntax**                | Pure HTML syntax                | HTML-like syntax, compiled to JS  |
| **Attribute Naming**      | Uses `class`, `for`, etc.       | Uses `className`, `htmlFor`, etc. |
| **Case Sensitivity**      | Not case-sensitive              | Case-sensitive                    |
| **Event Handlers**        | Uses traditional attributes     | Uses camelCase (e.g., `onClick`)  |
| **Browser Compatibility** | Directly understood by browsers | Needs transpilation via Babel     |

### Examples of Syntax Differences

1. **class vs className**

   ```jsx
   // HTML
   <div class="container">Hello</div>

   // JSX
   <div className="container">Hello</div>
   ```

2. **Inline Styles**

   ```jsx
   // HTML
   <div style="color: red; font-size: 16px;">Styled Text</div>

   // JSX
   <div style={{ color: "red", fontSize: "16px" }}>Styled Text</div>
   ```

3. **Event Handling**

   ```jsx
   // HTML
   <button onclick="alert('Clicked!')">Click Me</button>

   // JSX
   <button onClick={() => alert('Clicked!')}>Click Me</button>
   ```

4. **Self-Closing Tags**

   ```jsx
   // HTML
   <img src="image.jpg">

   // JSX
   <img src="image.jpg" />
   ```

---

## Q: Why is JSX preferred despite these differences?

### A:

JSX simplifies creating complex UIs by:

1. **Improved Readability:**

   - Developers can write code that resembles the final rendered output.
   - Nested components and dynamic content are easier to manage.

2. **Powerful Integration:**

   - Enables direct integration of JavaScript expressions within the template.
   - Example:
     ```jsx
     const name = "React";
     const greeting = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
     ```

3. **Error Prevention:**

   - Syntax rules and transpilation ensure that errors in JSX are caught during compilation.

4. **Community Adoption:**

   - Standard in the React ecosystem, making collaboration and code sharing seamless.

5. **Tooling and Ecosystem Support:**

   - Fully supported by modern tools like Babel, ESLint, and Parcel.

---

## Advantages of Using JSX with Babel

1. **Cross-Browser Compatibility:**

   - Babel ensures that JSX works seamlessly across different browser environments.

2. **Modern Syntax Features:**

   - Developers can write clean, modern code without worrying about compatibility.

3. **Error Detection:**

   - During transpilation, Babel identifies and reports syntax errors in JSX or JavaScript.

4. **Flexibility:**

   - Babel plugins can extend functionality, allowing developers to use cutting-edge features even before they are officially supported.

---

## Single-Line vs Multi-Line JSX
JSX allows you to structure your components in a clear and readable way.

### Single-Line JSX:

You can omit parentheses for single-line JSX. It’s concise and used for simpler JSX elements.

```jsx
const jsxHeading = <h1>Namaste React</h1>;
```

### Multi-Line JSX:

For multi-line JSX, parentheses are mandatory. They help Babel identify the start and end of the JSX block.

```jsx
const jsxHeading = (
  <div>
    <h1>Namaste React</h1>
    <p>Welcome to React JSX</p>
  </div>
);
```

### Key Points:

1. **Single-Line JSX**: 
   - No parentheses needed.
   - Ideal for simple elements.
2. **Multi-Line JSX**:
   - Requires parentheses.
   - Used for more complex structures.
3. **Why Parentheses in Multi-Line JSX?**:
   - Parentheses clearly indicate where JSX starts and ends, ensuring the code is parsed correctly by Babel.

---

What we studied previously was the concept of **React elements**. Now, let’s move ahead and explore **React components**.

## React Components

In React, **everything is a component**. Components are the building blocks of a React application. They allow you to create reusable, composable, and manageable UI pieces.

### Types of React Components

1. **Class-Based Components**:
   - The older way of writing React components.
   - Involves the use of ES6 classes.
   - Rarely used in modern React development.

2. **Functional Components**:
   - The modern and recommended way to write React components.
   - Based on JavaScript functions.
   - Easy to write, understand, and maintain.

---

## React Functional Components

A **React Functional Component** is a simple JavaScript function that:

1. Accepts `props` (optional).
2. Returns JSX (React Element) that defines the UI.

Functional components are widely used because they are lightweight and follow modern JavaScript practices.

### Key Characteristics of Functional Components:

- **Pure Functions**:
  - A functional component is essentially a pure function.
  - It takes inputs (props) and produces an output (JSX).

- **Capitalized Names**:
  - Component names must start with an uppercase letter to differentiate them from HTML elements.

- **JSX Output**:
  - A functional component always returns JSX.

### Syntax of Functional Components:

#### Single-Line Component:

```jsx
const HeadingComponent = () => <h1>Namaste React</h1>;
```

#### Multi-Line Component:

```jsx
const HeadingComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Namaste React</h1>
    <p>Welcome to React Functional Components</p>
  </div>
);
```

#### With `return` Keyword:

```jsx
const HeadingComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Namaste React</h1>
      <p>This is a React Functional Component</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

---

## Rendering a Functional Component

To render a functional component, you can use it just like an HTML tag:

```jsx
<HeadingComponent />
```

Alternatively, you can use:

- `<HeadingComponent></HeadingComponent>`
- `{HeadingComponent()}`

Example:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

const HeadingComponent = () => <h1>Namaste React Functional Component</h1>;

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<HeadingComponent />);
```

**Output:**

```html
<h1>Namaste React Functional Component</h1>
```

### Why Use Functional Components?

1. **Simplicity**:
   - Easy to write and maintain.
   - Less boilerplate code compared to class-based components.

2. **Performance**:
   - Functional components are faster and consume fewer resources.

3. **Hooks Compatibility**:
   - Hooks (like `useState` and `useEffect`) can only be used in functional components.

---

### Summary of Functional Components

1. **Definition**:
   - Functional components are JavaScript functions that return JSX.

2. **Syntax**:
   - Can be written as single-line or multi-line functions.
   - Use parentheses for multi-line JSX.

3. **Usage**:
   - Components must start with a capital letter.
   - Render them like HTML elements using `<ComponentName />`.

4. **Best Practice**:
   - Keep components small and focused.
   - Use them to encapsulate reusable UI logic.

---

Now that we understand functional components, let’s explore how to use **components within components**, a practice known as **component composition**.

## What is Component Composition?

**Component Composition** refers to the technique of building larger, more complex components by combining smaller, reusable components. This approach:

- **Enhances Reusability**: Small components can be reused across different parts of the application.
- **Improves Code Organization**: Complex UIs can be broken into modular pieces.
- **Encourages Separation of Concerns**: Each component handles a specific part of the UI.

---

### Example of Component Composition

#### Basic Component:

```jsx
const TitleComponent = () => (
  <h1 id="title" className="title">
    Title Component
  </h1>
);
```

#### Using the Component Inside Another Component:

```jsx
const HeadingComponent = () => (
  <div id="container">
    <TitleComponent />
    <h1 id="heading" className="head">Namaste React Functional Component</h1>
  </div>
);
```

### How It Works:

1. **`TitleComponent`**:
   - A simple component that returns a heading element.
2. **`HeadingComponent`**:
   - Calls `TitleComponent` inside a `div` container.

**Rendered Output in the Browser:**
```html
<div id="container">
  <h1 id="title" class="title">Title Component</h1>
  <h1 id="heading" class="head">Namaste React Functional Component</h1>
</div>
```

---

## Why Use Component Composition?

### Key Benefits:

1. **Reusability**:
   - Write once, use multiple times.
   - For example, a `Button` component can be reused across forms and dialogs.

2. **Modularity**:
   - Breaking down large UIs into smaller, manageable pieces.
   - Each component has its own responsibility.

3. **Improved Readability**:
   - Componentized code is easier to read and maintain.

4. **Encapsulation**:
   - Each component encapsulates its behavior and styling, reducing the risk of side effects.

---

## Nested Components in Practice

Let’s extend the example to include deeply nested components.

### Example:

```jsx
const FooterComponent = () => (
  <footer>
    <p>Footer Content</p>
  </footer>
);

const MainComponent = () => (
  <div id="main">
    <h2>Main Content</h2>
    <FooterComponent />
  </div>
);

const App = () => (
  <div id="app">
    <HeadingComponent />
    <MainComponent />
  </div>
);
```

### Output:

```html
<div id="app">
  <div id="container">
    <h1 id="title" class="title">Title Component</h1>
    <h1 id="heading" class="head">Namaste React Functional Component</h1>
  </div>
  <div id="main">
    <h2>Main Content</h2>
    <footer>
      <p>Footer Content</p>
    </footer>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Explanation:
1. **FooterComponent**:
   - A small component representing the footer.
2. **MainComponent**:
   - Includes the footer and some additional content.
3. **App**:
   - Combines `HeadingComponent` and `MainComponent` into a cohesive UI structure.

---

## Best Practices for Component Composition

1. **Keep Components Small**:
   - Each component should do one thing well.
   - Example: A `Button` component handles rendering and behavior for a button, not layout.

2. **Use Descriptive Names**:
   - Component names should clearly indicate their purpose.
   - Example: `LoginForm` vs `Form`.

3. **Prop Drilling When Necessary**:
   - Pass data between components via `props` to maintain clarity and avoid unnecessary global state.

4. **Reuse Components Across Features**:
   - Design components to be generic where possible, so they can be reused in different contexts.

---

## Summary of Component Composition

### What You’ve Learned:
1. **Defining Functional Components**:
   - Simple JavaScript functions returning JSX.
2. **Composing Components**:
   - Nesting components to build larger, reusable UIs.
3. **Modular Design**:
   - Breaking down the UI into small, manageable pieces for better scalability and maintainability.

## How to Use JavaScript Inside JSX?

JSX allows you to embed JavaScript logic seamlessly into your UI code. Using `{}` (curly braces), you can:

- Inject variables
- Perform calculations
- Call functions
- Log messages
- Use React elements or components

### Example 1: Injecting Variables
```jsx
const number = 10000;

const HeadingComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <h2>{number}</h2> {/* Outputs: 10000 */}
  </div>
);
```

### Example 2: Performing Calculations
```jsx
const HeadingComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <h2>{100 + 200}</h2> {/* Outputs: 300 */}
  </div>
);
```

### Example 3: Logging Inside JSX
```jsx
const HeadingComponent = () => (
  <div>
    {console.log("Hello from JSX!")}
    <h2>Check the console!</h2>
  </div>
);
```

---

## How to Call React Elements Inside JSX?

React elements are objects representing DOM nodes. You can inject them into JSX using `{}`. Because they are Javascript variables at the end of the day.

### Example: Using React Elements in JSX
```jsx
const elem = <span>React Element</span>;

const HeadingComponent = () => (
  <div>
    {elem} {/* Outputs the React element */}
    <h1>This is Namaste React</h1>
  </div>
);
```

---

## Key Superpowers of JSX

### 1. Embed JavaScript Expressions
JSX allows you to dynamically inject logic into your UI using `{}`.

#### Example: Dynamic Content
```jsx
const HeadingComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <h2>{new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}</h2> {/* Outputs current time */}
  </div>
);
```

### 2. Use React Elements Inside JSX
React elements can be injected directly into JSX to compose complex UIs.

## Calling React Components in JSX

React components can be rendered in JSX using the following approaches:

### 1. Self-Closing Tag
```jsx
<HeadingComponent />
```

### 2. Opening and Closing Tags
```jsx
<HeadingComponent></HeadingComponent>
```

### 3. Function Call Syntax
```jsx
{HeadingComponent()}
```

#### Example of All Three:
```jsx
const HeadingComponent = () => <h1>Namaste React</h1>;

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <HeadingComponent /> {/* Self-closing */}
    <HeadingComponent></HeadingComponent> {/* Opening and closing */}
    {HeadingComponent()} {/* Function call */}
  </div>
);
```

## Advantages of Using JSX

### 1. Security: Prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
JSX sanitizes inputs to prevent malicious code execution.

#### Example: Preventing XSS
```jsx
const maliciousInput = "<script>alert('XSS Attack!')</script>";

const SafeComponent = () => (
  <div>
    {maliciousInput} {/* JSX escapes the script and outputs it as plain text */}
  </div>
);
```

### 2. Readable and Intuitive Code
JSX provides an HTML-like syntax, making the code easy to read and write.

### 3. Simplifies Code Structure
With JSX, there’s no need to use verbose `React.createElement` calls.

### 4. Useful Errors and Warnings
JSX provides clear error messages, helping developers debug effectively.

### 5. Prevents Code Injection Attacks
By escaping inputs, JSX ensures secure rendering of dynamic content.

## Embedding React Components in JSX

### What is Component Composition?
Component composition refers to using one component inside another to create modular, reusable, and maintainable UI pieces.

### Example 1: Nesting Components
```jsx
const TitleComponent = () => <h1>Title Component</h1>;

const HeadingComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <TitleComponent /> {/* Injecting a component */}
    <h2>Namaste React</h2>
  </div>
);
```

### Example 2: Composing Components with Dynamic Content
```jsx
const SpanComponent = () => <span>This is a span tag</span>;

const TitleComponent = () => (
  <h1>
    Title Component
    <SpanComponent /> {/* Nested component */}
  </h1>
);

const HeadingComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <TitleComponent />
    <h2>Namaste React Functional Component</h2>
  </div>
);
```

---

## Avoiding Infinite Loops in Component Composition

### Issue: Circular References
If two components reference each other recursively, it will create an infinite loop.

#### Example: Circular Reference
```jsx
const ComponentA = () => <ComponentB />;
const ComponentB = () => <ComponentA />;
```
- **Result**: Stack overflow error and browser crash.

### Solution: Ensure Components Do Not Reference Each Other Indirectly
Avoid recursive calls in your component hierarchy.

## JSX: Best Practices

1. **Use CamelCase for Attributes**:
   - `className` instead of `class`
   - `tabIndex` instead of `tabindex`

2. **Wrap Multi-Line JSX in Parentheses**:
   - Improves readability and ensures proper parsing.

3. **Use Functional Components for Simplicity**:
   - Functional components are lightweight and easier to maintain.

4. **Avoid Inline Functions**:
   - Define functions outside JSX for better readability and performance.

5. **Sanitize Inputs**:
   - Always trust JSX to sanitize potentially malicious data.

---

## Key Takeaways

- JSX is not HTML but a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks like HTML.
- It allows you to inject JavaScript expressions, variables, and React elements seamlessly.
- JSX is transpiled to `React.createElement` by tools like Babel.
- It prevents cross-site scripting (XSS) by escaping malicious content.
- Component composition makes UI reusable and modular, but avoid circular dependencies.
- Use {} to inject React element.
- Use <self closing tag/>,<opening></and closing tag> or {function call()} to inject React Component.

### Summary
JSX bridges the gap between JavaScript and HTML-like syntax, making React development intuitive and secure. Use it to embed logic, sanitize data, and create maintainable, scalable components.
