# Chapter 2: Igniting Our App 

## What Does It Mean to "Ignite Our App"?

When we talk about "igniting our app," it refers to the process of preparing the application for production. This involves making our code production-ready, ensuring efficiency, scalability, and proper structure. Initially, our code consists of separate files like HTML, JavaScript, and markdown, which are not ready for production for the following reasons:

- **The code is not optimized**: Contains redundant lines, inefficient logic, or bulky dependencies.
- **Contains random comments and `console.log` statements**: These are helpful during development but must be removed for a clean and efficient production build.
- **Files are not bundled or minified**: Separate files need to be combined into fewer, smaller files for better performance.

### The "Create React App" Shortcut (Context in Tutorials)

In most tutorials, developers use `create-react-app` to start working on a project. This tool automatically sets up a production-ready React app, including necessary configurations, dependencies, and optimizations. However, in this chapter, we focus on understanding how to create a minimal version of `create-react-app` manually. This gives us insight into what happens behind the scenes.

## What Needs to Be Done to Make the App Production-Ready?

To make our app production-ready, we need to:

1. **Minify the Files**: Remove unnecessary elements such as comments and `console.log` statements.
2. **Bundle the Code**: Combine multiple files into a single file or a few smaller files to improve loading times.
3. **Optimize the App**: Ensure the code is clean, modular, and efficient.
4. **Set Up a Server**: Host the application locally or in the cloud for development or production.

### Steps for Production Readiness
The production-readiness process can be summarized as:

**Minify → Optimize → Clean Console → Bundle**

---

## Exploring the Tools Behind Production Readiness

### Can React Alone Make the App Production-Ready?

No. React, by itself, is a library for building UI components. While it is efficient and helps create fast and dynamic user interfaces, making an app production-ready involves more. Other tools, packages, and libraries are required for:

- Bundling the code.
- Minifying and optimizing files.
- Setting up a development or production server.
- Ensuring compatibility with various browsers and environments.

### Misconception
Many developers think React alone makes their app faster. While React plays a role, additional tools are needed for bundling, optimization, and scalability.

---

## Understanding `npm` (Node Package Manager)

### What is `npm`?

While commonly expanded as "Node Package Manager," `npm` is not an official abbreviation. It is:

- **A Standard Repository**: The largest collection of JavaScript libraries and tools.
- **A Package Manager**: Allows developers to install, update, and manage packages and dependencies.
- A tool to simplify project setups and manage versions.

Any package you need to enhance your project can be downloaded and installed via `npm`.

### How to Use `npm` in a Project

1. **Open the Terminal**: Start the terminal in your project directory.
2. **Run `npm init`**: This command initializes `npm` in the project and guides you through the setup prompts.
3. **Provide Basic Details**: Enter the following details (or let `npm` generate defaults):

   - **Name**: For example, `namaste-react`.
   - **Description**: A short summary, such as `This is Namaste React by Akshay Saini`.
   - **Test Command**: For testing, e.g., `jest`.

### The Result: `package.json`

Running `npm init` creates a `package.json` file in your project directory.

#### What is `package.json`?

- **Purpose**: A configuration file that acts as the central registry for project dependencies and metadata.
- **Lists Dependencies**: All external libraries or packages the project relies on are listed here.
- **Manages Scripts**: Allows defining custom commands (e.g., test, start, build).
- **Tracks Project Details**: Stores metadata like project name, version, author, and license.

#### Why Do We Need `package.json`?

- **Dependency Management**: Ensures that all required packages are installed and versioned correctly.
- **Project Maintenance**: Simplifies updates and collaboration by providing a single source of truth for dependencies.
- **Scalability**: Enables smooth scaling by making it easy to add or remove packages.

### Example `package.json`

Below is a sample `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "namaste-react-bhavesh",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "This is Namaste React by Akshay Saini",
  "main": "App.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/Bhaveshsao/Namaste-React-MyNotes.git"
  },
  "author": "Bhavesh Sao",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

Key Points to Note:
- `scripts`: Defines custom terminal commands. For example, running `npm test` executes the `jest` command.
- `dependencies`: Not shown here but will list packages installed for production.
- `devDependencies`: Not shown here but will list packages used during development only.

---

## Installing and Understanding Bundlers

### What is a Bundler?

A bundler is a tool that combines multiple files into one or a few files. Additionally, it:

1. **Cleans the Code**: Removes unused or redundant parts.
2. **Compresses the Code**: Reduces file size for faster downloads.
3. **Optimizes the Build**: Ensures the final output is efficient and production-ready.

#### Why Do We Need a Bundler?

Modern web applications often involve:
- Dozens or hundreds of JavaScript, CSS, and asset files.
- Complex dependency trees.

A bundler ensures that all these files are:
- Packaged efficiently.
- Minified and compressed.
- Managed for better performance.

#### Examples of Bundlers

1. **Webpack**: A highly configurable bundler used in `create-react-app`.
2. **Vite**: Known for its speed and modern architecture.
3. **Parcel**: Zero-configuration bundler with intelligent defaults.

In this chapter, we will use **Parcel** for its simplicity and minimal configuration.


## Using Parcel as a Bundler

### Why Use Parcel?

Parcel is a bundler that simplifies the process of combining, optimizing, and preparing code for production. It:

- Bundles all the files in the application into a single or smaller set of files.
- Cleans and minifies the code.
- Optimizes the app for better performance.
- Sets up a development server for real-time changes during development.

### Installing Parcel

To install Parcel in your app, you need a package manager like npm or yarn. Parcel comes as a node package and can be easily installed via npm.

#### Steps to Install Parcel

1. **Ensure `npm` is initialized**:
   - If `npm init` has already been run and a `package.json` file exists, you don’t need to run it again.

2. **Install Parcel as a Development Dependency**:
   Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -D parcel
   ```

   - The `-D` flag signifies that Parcel is a **development dependency**, meaning it is required only during the development phase.

3. **Result of Installation**:
   - A `package-lock.json` file is created.
   - Parcel is added as a devDependency in the `package.json` file:

     ```json
     "devDependencies": {
       "parcel": "^2.13.2"
     }
     ```

### Understanding `-D` Flag

The `-D` flag (short for `--save-dev`) is used to install packages as development dependencies. Development dependencies are used only during the development process, such as bundlers, linters, and testing libraries. They are not needed in the production environment.

---

## Exploring `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

### `package.json`

`package.json` is a configuration file for npm that contains information about the project and its dependencies. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "namaste-react-bhavesh",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "This is Namaste React by Akshay Saini",
  "main": "App.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/Bhaveshsao/Namaste-React-MyNotes.git"
  },
  "author": "Bhavesh Sao",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "parcel": "^2.13.2"
  }
}
```

- **`devDependencies`**: Lists packages required only during development, such as Parcel.
- **Purpose**: Acts as a blueprint for managing and installing project dependencies.

### `package-lock.json`

`package-lock.json` is automatically generated by npm when you install dependencies. It:

- **Locks Exact Versions**: Ensures consistency across environments by recording the exact versions of installed packages.
- **Tracks Transitive Dependencies**: Maintains details about sub-dependencies of installed packages.

#### Difference Between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

| Feature                | `package.json`                         | `package-lock.json`                     |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**            | Lists dependencies and metadata.       | Locks exact dependency versions.        |
| **Scope**              | High-level overview.                   | Detailed map of all dependencies.       |
| **Version Ranges**     | Uses version symbols (`^`, `~`).       | Locks specific versions.                |
### Versioning in `package.json`

#### Version Number Structure:
- **4.2.1**: 
  - **Major**: 4
  - **Minor**: 2
  - **Patch**: 1

#### Typical Version Progression:
1. **Initial Release**:
   - The first release for any project is usually `1.0.0`.

2. **Patch Release (`1.0.1`)**:
   - Fixes bugs or minor issues without adding new features or significant changes.
   - Ensures no impact on how the code is used.

3. **Minor Release (`1.1.0`)**:
   - Adds new features or functionality while maintaining backward compatibility.
   - No breaking changes, and users do not need to rewrite their code.

4. **Major Release (`2.0.0`)**:
   - Introduces breaking changes, such as removing or significantly altering features.
   - Not backward-compatible.

---

#### Tilde (`~`) and Caret (`^`) Symbols in `package.json`

When managing dependencies in Node.js projects, the `~` and `^` symbols define version constraints for flexibility and compatibility.

1. **Tilde (`~`)**:
   - Ensures backward compatibility with **patch-level updates**.
   - Allows updates to patch versions but not minor versions.
   - Example:
     ```json
     "dependencies": {
       "package-name": "~1.2.3"
     }
     ```
     - Updates to `1.2.4` but not `1.3.0`.

2. **Caret (`^`)**:
   - Ensures backward compatibility with **minor and patch updates**.
   - Allows updates to minor versions but not major versions.
   - Example:
     ```json
     "dependencies": {
       "package-name": "^1.2.3"
     }
     ```
     - Updates to `1.3.0` or `1.2.4` but not `2.0.0`.

---

#### Examples of Version Updates:
1. `"parcel": "~4.16.3"`
   - Updates to `4.16.4` but not `4.17.0`.

2. `"parcel": "^4.16.3"`
   - Updates to `4.17.0` or `4.16.4` but not `5.0.0`.

---

#### Summary of Versioning:

| Symbol   | Allowed Updates                 | Example                    | Updates To           |
|----------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| **`~`**  | Patch-level updates only        | `"~1.2.3"`                | `1.2.4` but not `1.3.0` |
| **`^`**  | Minor and patch-level updates   | `"^1.2.3"`                | `1.3.0`, `1.2.4` but not `2.0.0` |

---

#### Summary of Release Types:
1. **Patch Release (`1.0.1`)**:
   - Bug fixes without new features.
2. **Minor Release (`1.1.0`)**:
   - New features, backward-compatible.
3. **Major Release (`2.0.0`)**:
   - Breaking changes, not backward-compatible.

Understanding the distinction between `~` and `^` symbols is crucial for managing dependencies effectively and maintaining stability in your Node.js applications.


#### What Happens in `package-lock.json` During Updates?

- It records the exact updated version of each dependency.
- Ensures reproducibility even if new versions of dependencies are released.

#### Integrity Hash (`integrity`)

- Example:
  ```json
  "integrity": "sha512-oTf69/Ikxb7b8uqdu4SasRnIn7e68dCSNW2PhXuBkHq2GgzTSnpSqCwur70wQwrHKHdNt9RtIjLQgC6oOs5aJQ=="
  ```
- **Purpose**: Ensures the downloaded package is not tampered with by verifying its integrity.

---

## Understanding `node_modules`

### What is `node_modules`?

`node_modules` is a directory created when npm installs dependencies. It:

- **Stores Installed Packages**: Acts as a local database for all npm dependencies.
- **Includes Sub-Dependencies**: Each installed package’s dependencies are also included.
- **Contains Package Metadata**: Each dependency has its own `package.json`.

### Why is `node_modules` So Large?

- **Transitive Dependencies**: If a package depends on other packages, those sub-dependencies are also installed.
- **Package Tree**: Each dependency can have its own set of dependencies, leading to a large hierarchical structure.

### Managing `node_modules` in Git

- **Why Exclude It?**
  - Extremely large size.
  - Redundant since it can be regenerated using `npm install`.
- **How to Exclude It?**
  - Add `/node_modules` to `.gitignore`.

### `.gitignore`

The `.gitignore` file specifies which files or directories should not be tracked by version control. For example:

```
/node_modules
```

Once added, `node_modules` is excluded from Git, reducing the number of files to commit.

---

## Why Keep `package.json` and `package-lock.json` in Git?

- **`package.json`**: Maintains a list of required dependencies.
- **`package-lock.json`**: Ensures exact versions of dependencies are reproducible.

If `node_modules` is deleted, running `npm install` regenerates it using the data in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

### Regenerating `node_modules`

If `node_modules` is accidentally deleted:

1. Open the terminal.
2. Run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

This restores the exact dependencies and versions as recorded in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.


## Running the App with Parcel

Now we are ready to ignite our app.

To ignite our app, we use the `npx` command to execute Parcel and serve our application.

### Command Syntax

```bash
npx <name of the package> <entry point>
```

- **`npx`**: Executes packages using npm. Unlike `npm`, `npx` does not require the package to be globally installed. It looks for the package in `node_modules` or downloads it temporarily.
- **Package Name**: The name of the tool or library to execute (e.g., `parcel`).
- **Entry Point**: The starting file of the application (e.g., `index.html`).

### Example Command

```bash
npx parcel index.html
```

- **What happens?**: This command tells Parcel to:
  1. Read the `index.html` file (entry point).
  2. Bundle all required files.
  3. Start a development server.
  4. Serve the app at a local server (e.g., `http://localhost:1234`).

### Output in the Terminal

```bash
Server running at http://localhost:1234
✨ Built in 862ms
```

- **What does this mean?**:
  - **`Server running`**: Parcel has created a local development server.
  - **`http://localhost:1234`**: The app is accessible in the browser at this URL.
  - **`Built in 862ms`**: Parcel has bundled the files and completed the build process.

When you open the provided link in the browser, you can see your app running.

## Injecting React into the App

### Previous Method: Using CDN Links

Initially, React and ReactDOM were added to the app using CDN links. While this works, it is not the preferred method.

#### Why CDN Links Are Not Preferred

1. **Costlier Operation**: Each CDN link requires a network call, increasing load time.
2. **Dependency Management**: With `node_modules`, managing dependencies is simpler and more organized.
3. **Version Control**: Using npm allows explicit control over package versions.
4. **Offline Development**: With npm, packages are stored locally, enabling offline work.

---

## Installing React via npm

To include React in your app, install it as a dependency using npm.

### Install React and ReactDOM

```bash
npm install react react-dom
```

#### Why Not Use `-D`?

React is required in both development and production environments. Hence, it is added as a regular dependency instead of a dev dependency.

### Observations After Installation

1. **`package.json`**:
   ```json
   "dependencies": {
     "react": "^19.0.0",
     "react-dom": "^19.0.0"
   }
   ```
2. **`package-lock.json`**: Updates to include React and ReactDOM details.
3. **`node_modules`**: Adds `react` and `react-dom` folders.

### Deleting CDN Links

After installing React via npm, remove the CDN links from `index.html`. This ensures the app uses the locally installed React packages.

---

## Fixing Errors in the App

### Error: `'React is not defined'`

#### Cause
The app cannot recognize `React` because it has not been imported in the script.

#### Solution
Add the following lines to `App.js`:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
```

- **`import`**: A JavaScript ES6 syntax to include modules.
- **`React`**: Represents the React library.
- **`ReactDOM`**: Provides DOM-specific methods for rendering.

### Error: `Browser scripts cannot have imports or exports`

#### Cause
The browser treats `App.js` as a regular JavaScript file and does not support ES6 modules by default.

#### Solution
Modify the `<script>` tag in `index.html` to:

```html
<script type="module" src="./App.js"></script>
```

- **`type="module"`**: Informs the browser that the script uses ES6 modules.
- **Effect**: The browser now recognizes and processes `import` and `export` statements.

### Error: `TypeError: createRoot is not a function`

#### Cause
This occurs when using React 18+ but importing `ReactDOM` incorrectly.

#### Solution
Update the import statement in `App.js`:

```javascript
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
```

---

## Final Observations

- After fixing the above errors, the app runs perfectly.
- Parcel automatically refreshes the browser whenever changes are made to the code, thanks to its Hot Module Replacement (HMR) feature.
- The app is now using locally installed React and ReactDOM, improving efficiency and maintainability.

By completing this part, you have successfully learned to:
1. Use `npx` to run Parcel and start a development server.
2. Install React and ReactDOM via npm.
3. Configure scripts to support ES6 modules.
4. Fix common errors during the setup process.

This prepares the app for further development and scalability.


## Observing Parcel in Action

### Automatic Browser Refresh

When changes are made to the code, the browser automatically refreshes. This is made possible by Parcel’s **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)** feature.

#### Key Components Enabling This:

1. **HMR (Hot Module Replacement):**
   - Tracks updated files in real-time.
   - Replaces only the updated modules in the browser without a full reload.

2. **File Watching Algorithm:**
   - Written in C++ for high performance.
   - Monitors file changes and signals the server to reload.

3. **Parcel Caching:**
   - Speeds up builds by caching code.
   - Stores caches in a `.parcel-cache` folder.

#### What Happens If `.parcel-cache` Is Deleted?

- Parcel will rebuild the app from scratch.
- Subsequent builds will be slower until new caches are generated.

---

## Understanding the `dist` Folder

When you run:

```bash
npx parcel index.html
```

Parcel creates a `dist` folder. This folder contains the following:

1. **Minified Files:**
   - Reduces file size for faster loading.
2. **Optimized Code:**
   - Includes all compiled modules required for the app to run efficiently.

### Development vs Production Builds

- **Development Build:**
  ```bash
  npx parcel index.html
  ```
  - Creates a faster development version served on a local server.

- **Production Build:**
  ```bash
  npx parcel build index.html
  ```
  - Generates minified and optimized files for deployment.
  - Saves these files in the `dist` folder.

---

## Tree Shaking: Eliminating Unused Code

### What Is Tree Shaking?

Tree shaking is a dead code elimination technique. It removes unused pieces of code, resulting in:

- Smaller bundle sizes.
- Faster load times.
- Improved performance.

### How Parcel Implements Tree Shaking

Parcel analyzes the dependency tree and removes any modules or functions not used in the app.

---

## Ensuring Browser Compatibility with Browserslist

### What Is Browserslist?

Browserslist is a tool used to specify which browsers and versions the app should support. It ensures compatibility by configuring tools like Parcel to include necessary polyfills or transpiled code.

### Configuring Browserslist

Add the following to `package.json`:

```json
"browserslist": [
  "last 2 versions"
]
```

- **`last 2 versions`:** Ensures compatibility with the last two versions of all browsers (covers ~74% of users).

#### Customizing Browserslist

1. **Specific Browser Versions:**
   ```json
   "browserslist": [
     "last 2 chrome versions",
     "last 2 firefox versions"
   ]
   ```
   - Ensures compatibility with the last two versions of Chrome and Firefox.

2. **Older Browsers:**
   ```json
   "browserslist": [
     "> 0.5%",
     "not dead"
   ]
   - Supports browsers with >0.5% market share and excludes outdated browsers.
   ```

---

## Managing `.gitignore`

### Why Exclude Certain Files from Git?

Some files are large or auto-generated and do not need to be version-controlled. Examples include:

1. **`node_modules`:**
   - Contains all installed dependencies.
   - Can be regenerated using `npm install`.

2. **`dist`:**
   - Contains production build files, which are recreated during deployment.

3. **`.parcel-cache`:**
   - Stores temporary caches for faster builds.

### Example `.gitignore`

```plaintext
/node_modules
/dist
/.parcel-cache
```

This ensures only essential files are pushed to version control.

---

## Updating the Entry Point

### Current Entry Point Issue

The `package.json` file specifies `App.js` as the entry point:

```json
"main": "App.js"
```

This can cause issues because Parcel expects an HTML entry point.

### Solution

Remove the line specifying `App.js` as the main file. Parcel will automatically use `index.html` as the default entry point.

---
